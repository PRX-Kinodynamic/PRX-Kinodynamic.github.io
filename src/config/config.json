      "abstract": "Estimating the region of attraction (<tt>RoA</tt>) for a robot controller is essential for safe application and controller composition. Many existing methods require a closed-form expression that limit applicability to data-driven controllers. Methods that operate only over trajectory rollouts tend to be data-hungry. In prior work, we have demonstrated that topological tools based on Morse Graphs (directed acyclic graphs that combinatorially represent the underlying nonlinear dynamics) offer data-efficient <tt>RoA</tt> estimation without needing an analytical model. They struggle, however, with high-dimensional systems as they operate over a state-space discretization. This paper presents Morse Graph-aided discovery of Regions of Attraction in a learned Latent Space (<tt>MORALS</tt>). The approach combines auto-encoding neural networks with Morse Graphs. <tt>MORALS</tt> shows promising predictive capabilities in estimating attractors and their <tt>RoA</tt>s for data-driven controllers operating over high-dimensional systems, including a 67-dim humanoid robot and a 96-dim 3-fingered manipulator. It first projects the dynamics of the controlled system into a learned latent space. Then, it constructs a reduced form of Morse Graphs representing the bistability of the underlying dynamics, i.e., detecting when the controller results in a desired versus an undesired behavior. The evaluation on high-dimensional robotic datasets indicates data efficiency in <tt>RoA</tt> estimation.",

It adopts a decoupled strategy, where a system-specific controller is first trained offline in an empty environment to deal with the robot's dynamics. For a target environment, the proposed approach constructs offline a data structure, a \"Roadmap with Gaps,\" to approximately learn how to solve planning queries in this environment using the learned controller. The nodes of the roadmap correspond to local regions. Edges correspond to applications of the learned control policy that approximately connect these regions. Gaps arise because the controller does not perfectly connect pairs of individual states along edges. Online, given a query, a tree sampling-based motion planner uses the roadmap so that the tree's expansion is informed towards the goal region. The tree expansion selects local subgoals given a wavefront on the roadmap that guides towards the goal. When the controller cannot reach a subgoal region, the planner resorts to random exploration to maintain probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality. The accompanying experimental evaluation shows that the approach significantly improves the computational efficiency of motion planning on various benchmarks, including physics-based vehicular models on uneven and varying friction terrains as well as a quadrotor under air pressure effects.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to increase the safety and reliability of executing trajectories planned for robots with non-trivial dynamics given a light-weight, approximate dynamics model. Scenarios include mobile robots navigating through workspaces with imperfectly modeled surfaces and unknown friction. The proposed approach, <tt>K</tt>inodynamic <tt>R</tt>eplanning over <tt>A</tt>pproximate Models with <tt>F</tt>eedback <tt>T</tt>racking (<tt>KRAFT</tt>), integrates: (i) replanning via an asymptotically optimal sampling-based kinodynamic tree planner, with (ii) trajectory following via feedback control, and (iii) a safety mechanism to reduce collision due to second-order dynamics. The planning and control components use a rough dynamics model expressed analytically via differential equations, which is tuned via system identification (SysId) in a training environment but not the deployed one. This allows the process to be fast and achieve long-horizon reasoning during each replanning cycle. At the same time, the model still includes gaps with reality, even after SysID, in new environments. Experiments demonstrate the limitations of kinematic path planning and path tracking approaches, highlighting the importance of: (a) closing the feedback-loop also at the planning level; and (b) long-horizon reasoning, for safe and efficient trajectory execution given inaccurate models."
